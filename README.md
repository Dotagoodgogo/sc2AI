## Initial_intentions_and_goals:
Because addiction for real-time strategy games. Starcraft 2 has always been a game that I love. Although the game has gradually fallen, but he is still the ceiling of real-time strategy games. 2019 Google speaks of research AI environment turned to StarCraft 2 this game, and research Alphastar and Deepmind with amazing ability to beat almost 90% of the players, become a great hit in the field of AI at that time. Meanwhile with the development of AI technology. These are the reasons why I wrote the code for StarCraft 2. Also the goal of writing this code is to take my passion for StarCraft 2 and make a Bot, while incorporating reinforcement learning to make my own intelligent Bot.

## Current_phase:
The code is not easy to write due to the overly complex nature of the game. The current Bot can beat Very Hard StarCraft 2's own computer. But Bot temporary strategy single, mainly has been the main development. If you encounter Rush tactics. My Bot is very easy to beat.
For the time being, I have not used reinforcement learning to let Bot judge various response strategies in complex situations by itself.

## Future_goals:
I will continue to develop Bot's strategy, while reinforcement learning will be introduced. I hope I can make my own AI.

## 初衷和目标：
出于对即时战略类的游戏的热爱。星际争霸2一直是我热爱的一款游戏。虽然游戏已经逐渐没落，但是他还是即时战略类游戏的天花板。2019年谷歌讲研究AI环境转向星际争霸2这款游戏，并且研究出了Alphastar 和 Deepmind 以惊人的能力几乎可以击败九成玩家，成为当时AI领域很大的热门。同时随着AI科技的发展。这些是我写星际2代码的原因。同时写这代码的目标是希望把我对星际争霸2的热情制作成一个Bot,同时融入强化学习来制作出我自己的智能Bot.

## 现在的阶段：
由于游戏过度复杂的情况，代码是不容易写出来的。目前的Bot可以击败Very Hard 星际争霸2自己的电脑。但是Bot暂时策略单一，主要已发展为主。如果遇到Rush战术。我的Bot是很容易被击败的
暂时还没有运用强化学习来让Bot在复杂的情况自己判断各种应对策略。

## 未来目标:
我会继续发展Bot的战略，同时强化学习会将引入。希望可以做出我自己的AI
